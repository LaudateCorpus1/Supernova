# Supernova

Supernova is an open source UCI chess engine for Windows. It requires a UCI compatible graphical user interface such as Arena to function properly. It uses transposition tables to improve search capability so 130MB of memory is required, and it supports pondering option. The exact strengh of the engine needs to be tested but I estimated it to be around 2100 to 2300 elo.

To download the engine, you can download the Supernova.zip which contains the executable directly from 1.0 release, or alternatively, you can download all source files and Makefile and then run make on Windows. To use the engine with a GUI, you need to add it to the GUI first. I recommend using Arena as your GUI and add the engine via Engines -> Install New Engine and select the executable. The link to download Arena is given below.
